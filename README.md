VIM Beautifiers
===============

It is an extremely simple pluging that works as a replacement
to online beatutifying tools I'm using quite ofter to
structure contents of the log files.

How it works:
  1. Paste contents to the buffer
  2. Run a command.

Supported commands:
  * `:JSONbeautify` - Vim JSON beautifier
  * `:XMLbeautify` - Vim XML beautifier

Pull requests and feedback are always welcome.

Install using Vundle
--------------------

```
:PluginInstall xni/vim-beautifiers
