VIM Beautifiers
===============

It is extremely simple pluging that works as a replacement
to online beatutifying tools I'm using quite ofter to
structure contents of the log files.

How it works:
  1. Paste contents to the buffer
  2. Run a command.

Supported commands:
  * `:JSONbeautify`
  * `:XMLbeautify`

Pull requests and feedback are always welcome.

Install using Vundle
